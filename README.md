# Ezerko
An app made for the 2018 SST changemakers programme.

# Problem:
- People do not know how to train for NAPFA
- 70% of polytechnic students fail NAPFA/fitness tests
- 20-30% of JC students fail the NAPFA/IPPT/fitness test
- 50% of ITE students fail the NAPFA/IPPT/fitness test

# Our app:
- Shows you how to train for your NAPFA with our compilation of exercises for each station
 - We offer detailed instructions and even a gif so that you will be able to perform the exercises correctly and safely
 - We even show you the rubrics appropriate for your age group for each segment
 - All instructions are also verified by our Sports and Wellness Teachers!
- Offers a search function so that you can effortlessly search and find the exercise that you would want to do
- Provides a function where you can key in your grade for each station
  - The data when then in be presented as graphs in the report page along with your BMI so that you can see your progress
  - The overall score will also be calculated for you automatically once data for all segments are filled in
